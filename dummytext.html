        <h1> Dopex </h1>

        <p> Dopex is an <strong> options protocol </strong> with a peer to pool model. 
        Which means that all the writers (sellers) of options are pooled together.   
    </p>
<!-- This is just my ideas -->
    <p> I know we just talked about sellers, so lets quickly go over the parties in options.
        There are <em> 3 parties, buyers sellers and platform </em>
        The buyer buys option contracts. The seller sells options contracts.
        The platform is the meeting place between buyers and sellers.
        So the buyers make money from bad deals by the sellers and vice versa.
        The platform makes money by taking a small cut in the transaction between the two parties.
        So the platform has big incentive to maximize volume/trades.
