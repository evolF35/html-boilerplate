            Gifs are the go to option for simple animations. However they are limited in the color palette so don't use them for photos.
            You cannot have semi-opaque pixels either.

    jpgs are good for photos, ie images with a lot of gradients in them. However
    they don't allow for transparant pixels.

            PNGs are great for anything besides a photo or animations. Excellent fit for icons, logos, and technical diagrams.
            They would be a bigger file than a JPG file but the quality would essentially be the same. 
            Don't have color palette limitations and opacity is fine.

            SVG is vector based graphics format. It scales up or down without loss of quality. 
            It is a wonderful tool for responsive design. They are good for the same use cases as PNGs.
            Use them whenever you can.
            However there is one potential issue. If your image contain a lot of text, it can have a huge impact on file size.
